// QREWARDS (multi-pool) - open ecosystem loyalty & dividend platform.
//
// Anyone can createPool(): each pool has its own creator/admin and its own asset
// registry. Holding a pool's registered assets earns a weighted "share" of that
// pool's dividends.
//
// DISTRIBUTION MODEL (pure snapshot, qRWA-style):
//   Dividends are NOT tracked as a persistent soulbound balance. Instead, each
//   deposit (minus the 5% fee) accumulates into a per-currency POT for the pool.
//   At END_EPOCH the contract reads LIVE holdings straight from the asset ledger,
//   computes each holder's weight (per-asset points x concentration multiplier x
//   price weight, exactly like previewWeight), and pays out the pot pro-rata by
//   weight. Because every epoch reads the real ledger, a holder who sold cannot be
//   paid (their live balance is 0) and the same tokens can never be counted twice
//   -- there are no stale "ghost" positions. This is why there is no claim/sync
//   step and no persistent per-user balance.
//
// Each pool can pay dividends in up to QREWARDS_MAX_DIV_CURRENCIES currencies
// (slot 0 = QU by default; pool admin can add asset currencies, e.g. QDOGE).
// Pools are fully isolated: a pool can only ever pay out what was deposited to it.
//
// NOTE ON SCALE: END_EPOCH distribution iterates each active pool's registered
// assets' holders. It is designed for a handful of active pools of up to a few
// thousand holders each (QREWARDS_SNAPSHOT_CAP). It is NOT a mass multi-tenant
// sweep of thousands of busy pools in one epoch.
//
// NOTE ON TIMING: distribution uses the END_EPOCH snapshot only. That fully
// prevents stale/ghost over-payment, but does not by itself stop someone buying
// a large position right before the epoch boundary to grab that epoch's dividend
// (and selling after). A min(begin,end) rule would require a BEGIN_EPOCH snapshot;
// see docs/qrewards-build-guide.md.
//
// See docs/qrewards-build-guide.md for the full design rationale.
